          <h5>Phase 1: Planning</h5>
          Each player (from left to right) picks three different actions, which
          will be played in the upcoming round from top to bottom. Once the
          actions are picked, the “READY” button hides them from other players.

          <h5>Phase 2: Robbery</h5>
          Once all the players pick their actions, the “START” button initiates
          the next round, and performs all the picked actions one by one,
          displaying them on the screen.

          <h5>Phase 3: Round End</h5>
          Once all players performed their actions, the last wagon unhooks from
          the train, and players standing on it are leaving the game. Closest to
          the last wagon player gets the $. In case of a draw, player standing
          on the wagon’s roof gets the $. The first turn is passed to the next
          player (displayed under the map), and the Phase 1 - Phase 3 repeat.

          <h5>Game End</h5>
          Game ends once only one player remains on the train, or all the wagons
          were unhooked. In that case the player with more $ wins.
        </td>
        <td>
          <h4>Actions</h4>
          <h5>Fire<img class="action_img_rules" src="/sprites/fire_logo.png" /></h5>
          Shoot the nearest player you are facing. The bullet flies through the
          wagons till it hits someone. Player can’t shoot someone standing on
          the roof, while standing inside the wagon and vice-versa. Shot player
          shifts one wagon in direction of a bullet, and lies down. Lying
          players can’t be shot, the bullet flies over them. Shot players
          shifted out of the train leave the game. If the player is shot,
          instead of performing an action during its turn, the player stands up.
          <h5>Turn around<img class="action_img_rules" src="/sprites/turn_around_logo.png"/></h5>
          Turn your player opposite direction its facing now.
          <h5>
            Climb<img class="action_img_rules" src="/sprites/climb_logo.png" />
          </h5>
          Move your player to the top or to the bottom of the wagon.
          <h5>Move<img class="action_img_rules" src="/sprites/move_logo.png" /></h5>
          Move your player inside the next wagon, if the player stands inside
          the wagon, or on top of the next wagon, if the player stands on top of
          the wagon, in the direction it’s facing. Players moved out of the
          train leave the game.
